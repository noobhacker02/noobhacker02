## 🧠 Personality (brief & honest)
I’m driven, slightly dramatic, and motivated by getting better — sometimes my ego pushes me hard (in a good way). I overthink features until they’re elegant, prefer API-first design, and I love turning messy client asks into solid products. I also enjoy anime and salty dev humor — low-key, dark, but still human.
